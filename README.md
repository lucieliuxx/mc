# mc
This is an example of the code I developed during my PhD in Physical Chemistry at the Geissler Group, UC Berkeley. 

The theoretical framework for the code is a Ising-like lattice model that has been fine-tuned to mimic the behaviors of a lipid system undergoing self-assembly. 

To run this code, use the bashscript src/run.sh to compile and execute. Various parameters and other options for the simulations are configurable in src/run.sh and are mostly self-explanatory.
